## Software Packages

`smalldiffusion`
[(https://github.com/yuanchenyang/smalldiffusion/)](https://github.com/yuanchenyang/smalldiffusion/)
is a lightweight Python package for training and sampling from diffusion
models. It is built for easy experimentation when training new models and
developing new samplers, supporting minimal toy models to state-of-the-art
pretrained models. The core of this library is implemented in less than 100
lines of very readable PyTorch code. We will use this package for class
assignments.

Huggingface `diffusers`
[(https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)
is a feature-rich library implementing state-of-the-art models. Although it has
a large collection of models and pipelines, it has grown in complexity and is
less suitable for pedagogical purposes.
