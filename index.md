## Course Objectives

After this course, you should be able to:
 - Know what is a diffusion model, what are its components, and how they work together
 - Understand the different perspectives and theoretical underpinnings of diffusion models
 - Control the sampling process of pretrained diffusion models and use them for downstream tasks such as conditional generation, image restoration, and 3D model generation
 - Design and train diffusion models on custom datasets


## Prerequisites

Python programming, basic linear algebra, probability and mathematical maturity (e.g. 18.06, 18.02, 6.042). Experience with PyTorch will be helpful.

## Grading

Grading with be P/D/F, 18 points and above required to receive credit.
 - Attendance/participation (6 points)
 - Problem Sets (12 points)
 - Mini Project (4 points)

## Problem Sets

There will be 2 short problem sets, assigned after lectures 1 and 3 and due in approximately 1 week. Each problem set will have a few theoretical/math questions, as well as a coding component. Most of the coding questions will not require GPUs. For any questions that require GPUs, we will provide a notebook that can be run on the free tier of Google Colab. The purpose of the problem sets is to help students check their own understanding and give them practice working with diffusion models. Grading will be coarse and mostly be based on completion.

## Mini Project

During the second week students will have the opportunity to complete a mini project and apply what they have learnt about diffusion models to a problem of their interest. Potential projects include new applications using pretrained models or training diffusion models on custom datasets.
