**Instructions:**
 - The miniproject is worth 4 points and is optional (if you choose not to do the project, you will have to participate in all 6 lectures and do both homeworks to get credit for the class)
 - To get credit, you need to submit a pdf report to Gradescope.
 - The report is due by the last day of class **Fri Jan 17 11:59pm**.
 - You can work in groups of up to 3 students

**Project ideas:**
 - Train diffusion models on new modalities besides images
 - Creative applications of pretrained models (e.g. generating visual illusions)
 - Apply diffusion models to your own research
